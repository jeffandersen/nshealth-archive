The number of potential COVID-19 exposures is too long to process manually now. This script will take the URL of the Nova Scotia Health news entry and convert it to a a flat file of locations and dates of potential COVID-19 exposure.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:jeffandersen/nshealth-archive.git
cd nshealth-archive
```

## Usage

The default way is to pass the URL of exposures as the first argument:

```
./bin/scrape [URL]
```

This will create files in both CSV and JSON format for consumption.

#### Example

```
$ ./bin/scrape https://www.nshealth.ca/news/potential-covid-19-exposure-21-halifax-locations
$ cat ./data/csb/tuesday-november-24-2020-0822pm.csv
